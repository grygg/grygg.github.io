Glad to see you here! My name is Ruiying Geng (耿瑞莹), currently an NLP researcher at Alibaba Damo Academy. I got my master degree from Beijing Institute of Technology, 2019.

My research interest focuses on semantic parsing, dialogue system, and few-shot learning.
* Semantic Parsing: focusing on techniques to convert natural language into programing languages such as SQL and SPARQL.
