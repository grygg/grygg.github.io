Glad to see you here. My name is Ruiying Geng (耿瑞莹), currently a NLP researcher at Alibaba Damo Academy. I got my master degree from Beijing Institute of Technology, 2019.

My research interest focuses on semantic parsing, dialogue system, and few-shot learning.
* Semantic Parsing: focusing on techniques to convert natural language into programing languages such as SQL and SPARQL.
* Dialogue System: focusing on solutions for coreference and ellipsis.
* Few-Shot Learning: focusing on machine learning solutions based on few annotations.
